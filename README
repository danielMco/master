== Master Service ==
The Master Service acts as the orchestrator,
 distributing tasks to the registered Minion services and aggregating the results.

Key Components:
Task Management: Manages password-cracking tasks and assigns them to registered Minions.
Minion Registry: Maintains a list of Minions that have registered with the Master.

Key Endpoints:
POST /master/registerMinion: Registers a new Minion.
POST /master/assignTask: Sends a task to a registered Minion.
POST /master/receiveResult: Receives results from Minions.
